# Socket Communication Specification  
The websocket communication allows to send Python *dictionaries*, in such a way that on the Front end we can transform them into **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**.  
We **cannot** send *Models*. We can only send plain strings, or python dictionaries.  
This file specifies what the Front end expects from the websocket.  
## **General structure:**  
Sending pure strings are depreciated. Even basic chat will be sent by dictionary. The structure of all messages will be of the form:  

`{ "TYPE": ..., "PAYLOAD": ... }`

The *keys* `TYPE` and `PAYLOAD` should always be present
The value of `TYPE` signals the type of **action** we're sending the player, the value in `PAYLOAD` is relevant information (read: *arguments*) necesary to perform the action.

# Python Dictionaries:  
## Initialization  
There are two common ways to create a dictionary. One is already with some keys we're going to use:  

`myDict = { "KEY_1" : 1, "KEY_2" : 2 }`  

The other is creating a empty one and then adding the vales 1 by 1:  

`myDict = {}`  
`myDict["KEY_1"] = 1`  
`myDict["KEY_2"] = 2`  

This can be done with loops:  
    
    myDict = {}
    for (i in range(1, 11)):
        key = f"KEY_{i}"
        myDict[key] = i

## Subdictionaries (dictionaries as value)  
Pretty much anything (except classes) can be put as value and key of a dictionary. keys must be immutable (string, ints, ...)  
But values can be that and also **Lists** or other **dictionaries**  

`subdict = { "KEY_A" : "SOMETHING", "KEY_B" : 4 }`  
`myDict = { "KEY_1" : "SOME NAME", "KEY_2" : subdict }` 

## Lists of values:  
If we need to send a list of entries with information about the players for example, we simply can construct the subdictionary and then put it as value:  

    players = dbe.get_players_by...(...) # get players
    subdict = {}
    for player in players:
        player_vote = player...vote # get vote
        subdict[player.player_nick] = player_vote
    finalDict = { "TYPE": "ELECTION_RESULT", "VOTES": subdict }
    await ... broadcast ... (..., message=finalDict) # Send socket
